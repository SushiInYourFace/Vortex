## Designed with the Toychat Server in Mind
Toybot, based off of the open-source Vortex bot, has been redesigned to focus on needs specific to the IBXToyChat Discord community. It is tailor-made to be able to do everything the server desires, an ability that cannot be found in any generic moderation bot.


## Helpful Moderation Utilities
No matter the community, there will always be some amount of 'bad apples'. When these 'bad apples' appear, it should be easy to deal with them. This bot's features make it easy for the moderation team to enact a punishment that perfectly fits the situation. With options ranging from warns to mutes to 'gravels' to bans, keeping a server a safe and friendly place for all becomes a simple, intuitive task.

## Development
All modifications to this bot have been created by members of the Toychat server. As this is a community-made project, development may be slow. If you want to contribute, any and all help is welcome! It is reccomended that you familiarize yourself with the current status of the bot, and what needs to be done, however. 

## Use Cases
This bot is designed specifically for the Toychat community, but that does not mean it cannot work in other servers. However, this project is still very much incomplete, so using this bot in its current state is not recommended. One alternative is to use the [Vortex](https://github.com/jagrosh/Vortex) bot, which Toybot is a fork of.

### Please note, these links lead to information on the original Vortex bot, not Toybot. As many of the features have been reworked, it is very likely that the support listed here will not apply to (bot name).
